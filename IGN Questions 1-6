        <p><center><tr><td><strong>A1.</strong></td></tr> How many cars cross the Bay Bridge daily?</center></p>
        <p><center>According to the CA.gov, roughly 270,000 cars cross the Bay Bridge daily, which means roughly half or <strong>135,000 cars</strong> are coming from Oakland into San Francisco.</center></p>
        <br>
        <p><center><tr><td><strong>A2.</strong></td></tr> How many people does this translate to?</center></p>
        <p><center>If <strong>135,000 cars</strong> are crossing into San Francisco from Oakland, lets say that the average carpooling car has at least 2 people, so I would think that roughly <strong>270,000 people</strong> are crossing into San Francisco from Oakland.</center></p>
        <br>
         <p><center><tr><td><strong>A3.</strong></td></tr> How many gamers make the crossing?</center></p>
          <p><center>If <strong>270,000 people</strong> are coming into San Francisco from Oakland, and according to the ESA 2013 Survey, <strong>about 58%</strong> of all US citizens are gamers. So if you take 58% of 270,000, then <strong>roughly 170,886 people</strong> coming into San Francisco are gamers.</center></p>

           <p><center><tr><td><strong>E1.</strong></td></tr> A driver has gained access to a <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/06/watch-dogs-release-date-leaked-in-trailer">Watch Dogs</a>
    type device that allows them control over the metering lights. Assuming the driver wishes to maintain his 50mph cruising speed throughout, and assuming we want to allow
    access to the lights, describe all the assumptions that should be made. For example, assume the lights are wi-fi and therefore have infinite device range.</center></p>

        <p><center><tr><td><strong>6.</strong></td></tr> If you feel neither question above will show off your skills and what makes you a great fit for IGN, this is your question to shine. Design and buiild something you feel is a fair representation of your talents and contributions, and submit it.</center></p>
        <p><center>I may not know so much about complex coding, but I included one of my mods for Civilization 5 (which by the way is super OP, so don't be shocked if you wind up with a bunch of happiness right away; it's also a Final Fantasy XIII Mod.) and a mod for FTL: Faster Than Light. I really do hope all of you will consider me for taking this six week internship, as I wish to expand my knowledge of coding while get the real world experience that I want!</center></p>
